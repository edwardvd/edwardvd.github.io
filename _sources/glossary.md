AGS
    Aerobic granular sludge: Aggregates of activated sludge, larger than 200 &micro;m of microbial origin, that do not aggregate and settle significantly faster than activated sludge flocs.

SBR
    Sequencing Batch Reactor: a type of wastewater treatment system, in which all processes happen sequentially in the same reactor. 

UASB
    Upflow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket reactor: wastewater treatment process based on *anaerobic* granular sludge.

PAO
    Phosphorus Accumulating Organisms: a group of bacteria that can remove large amounts of phosphorus from wastewater, in AGS often *Ca* Accumulibacter phosphatis, by sequestering {term}`VFA<VFA>`'s from wastewater anaerobically.

GAO
    Glycogen Accumulating Organisms: a group of bacteria than compete with {term}`PAO<PAO>` for {term}`VFA<VFA>` in wastewater, without the benefit of removing large amounts of phosphorus from the wastewater.

RHDHV
    Royal HaskoningDHV: an international engineering consultancy firm with headquarters in Amersfoort and the company I am working for.

PNU
    Prototype Nereda Utrecht: a 1000 m<sup>3</sup> full-scale Nereda<sup>&#174;</sup> pilot, located in Utrecht.

mUCT
    modified University of Capetown process: wastewater treatment process consisting from anaerobic, anoxic and aerobic reactors, accommodating biological nitrogen and phosphorus removal.

SND
    Simultaneous Nitrification and Denitrification: a process where under aerobic condition in a biofilm nitrification and denitrification happen simultaneously.

VFA
    Volatile Fatty Acids: fatty acids with less than six carbon atoms. Especially acetate and propionate can be sequestered by {term}`PAO<PAO>` and {term}`GAO<GAO>`.

EBPR
    Enhanced Biological Phosphorus Removal: a wastewater treatment configuration stimulating growth of phosphorus accumulating organisms.

DWF
    Dry Weather Flow: flow from a sewer network during dry weather conditions.

RWF
    Rainy Weather Flow: flow from a sewer network during rainy weather conditions. Typically 5&hairsp;-&hairsp;10&hairsp;x larger than the {term}`DWF<DWF>`

GRTD
    Granule Residence Time Distribution: a aerobic granular sludge reactor has granules of different age, up to 150 d. This distribution is an important parameter for the reactor performance.

ASM
    Activated Sludge Model: mathematical framework for simulating wastewater treatment processes.

CAS
    Conventional Activated Sludge: wastewater treatment system based on activated sludge flocs in a continuous flow-through application.

VER
    Volumetric Exchange Ratio: the relative reactor volume that is replaces during influent during the feeding phase of an SBR reactor.

HDSR
    Hoogheemraadschap de Stichtse Rijnlanden: Dutch water authority in the Utrecht region.

GFS
    Granule Forming Substrate: substrates that can lead to formation of aerobic granules, such as {term}`VFA's<VFA>` or other readily biodegradable substrates.

NGFS
    non-Granule Forming Substrate: substrates that will not directly lead to formation of aerobic granules.

PBM
    Population Balance Model: mathematical modelling technique, in which growth of individuals in a population is simulated.

MLSS
    Mixed Liquor Suspended Solids: concentration of suspended solids in a wastewater treatement process.

EF
    Emission Factor: relative emission of N<sub>2</sub>O, related to the total nitrogen load in the influent of a wastewater treatment plant.
