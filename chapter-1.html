<h2>A brief history<a class="headerlink" href="#a-brief-history" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>Edward Ardern and William T. Lockett are widely recognized as the inventors of the activated sludge process <span id="id1">[<a class="reference internal" href="references.html#id14" title="D. Jenkins and J. Wanner. Activated Sludge – 100 Years and Counting. apr 2014. doi:10.2166/9781780404943.">Jenkins and Wanner, 2014</a>]</span>. Their discovery was that the retention of sludge in a reactor greatly improved the reaction rates in the nitrification process <span id="id2">[<a class="reference internal" href="references.html#id13" title="E. Adern and W. T. Lockett. The oxidation of sewage without the aid of filters. J. Soc. Chem. Ind., 33(10):523–539, 1914. doi:10.1002/jctb.5000331005.">Adern and Lockett, 1914</a>]</span>. The set-up they used in their experiments was very similar to what we use today for research of <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-AGS"><span class="xref std std-term">AGS</span></a>. They would fill a bottle of 2.4 L, with biomass and influent. Then after aerating the bottle for multiple hours, the mixture was allowed to settle and the clear effluent was decanted. The biomass was retained in the bottle and fed the next batch of influent. They found that sludge retention was an important mechanism for <em>activating</em> the sludge. Looking back, they came surprisingly close to the invention of <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-AGS"><span class="xref std std-term">Aerobic Granular Sludge</span></a>, but history tells us that it took more than 80 years for this fact to happen <span id="id3">[<a class="reference internal" href="references.html#id6" title="J.

The main reason for this might be the absence of automated valves that made the use of full-scale fill-and-draw batch systems almost impossible for many decades to come and for this reason the world moved towards continuous flow systems <span id="id4">[<a class="reference internal" href="references.html#id14" title="D.

But there are some key developments in wastewater treatment I need to address, that made the discovery of AGS possible. As the reader will notice, this dissertation is for a large part about the differences and similarities between conventional activated sludge and AGS. There are a few key mechanisms that are important for growing AGS, which are discussed in detail in chapter <a class="reference internal" href="chapter-5.html#ch-mechanisms"><span class="std std-ref">On the mechanisms</span></a>. One of the marker points in the history of <em>aerobic</em> granular sludge was the discovery of <em>anaerobic</em> granular sludge. In the early 1970’s the Dutch sugar factor CSM worked together with the Landbouw Hogeschool Wageningen, to develop a compact solution for anaerobic treatment of wastewater from sugar beet  processing. This led to the development of the <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-UASB"><span class="xref std std-term">UASB</span></a> <span id="id6">[<a class="reference internal" href="references.html#id12" title="G. Lettinga, A. G. N. Jansen, and P. Terpstra. Anaerobe zuivering van bietsuikerafvalwater. H2O, pages 530–536, 1975.">Lettinga <em>et al.</em>, 1975</a>]</span>. In the decades after the discovery of anaerobic granular sludge the technology was rapidly adopted worldwide and new concepts like the Expanded Granular Sludge Bed and Internal Circulation reactors were introduced. Meanwhile the search for aerobic equivalents of these technologies started. First successes were made with biomass on carrier systems <span id="id7">[<a class="reference internal" href="references.html#id7" title="J. J. Heijnen, A. Mulder, R. Weltevrede, P. H. Hols, and H. L. J. M. van Leeuwen. Large-scale anaerobic/aerobic treatment of complex industrial wastewater using immobilized biomass in fluidized bed and air-lift suspension reactors. Chem. Eng. Technol., 13(1):202–208, 1990. doi:10.1002/ceat.270130127.">Heijnen <em>et al.</em>, 1990</a>, <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#id8" title="J. J. Heijnen, M. C.

Technol., 27(5-6):253–261, 1993. doi:10.2166/wst.1993.0505.">Heijnen <em>et al.</em>, 1993</a>]</span>. In these biofilm suspended carrier systems similar physical properties were reached as we now know from AGS: terminal settling velocities of 50 m h<sup>-1</sup>, volatile suspended solids of up to 40 g L<sup>-1</sup> and superficial velocities in the clarifier up to 30 m h<sup>-1</sup>. In this same period researchers started to understand that the morphology of the aerobic biofilm resulted from a balance between biofilm loading rate and shear rate (or a balance between growth and detachment) <span id="id8">[<a class="reference internal" href="references.html#id4" title="M. C. M. van Loosdrecht, D. Eikelboom, A. Gjaltema, A. Mulder, L. Tijhuis, and J. J. Heijnen. Biofilm Structures. Water Sci.

These granules were grown in an SBR with molasses as substrate and the SBR was operated completely aerobic, without an anaerobic feeding phase.

It was also recognized that the conversion of rapidly biodegradable substrates into slowly biodegradable stored substrates by applying an anaerobic feeding phase and an aerobic famine phase, greatly improved the granule stability and removed the need for high shear forces <span id="id12">[<a class="reference internal" href="references.html#id9" title="M.

<h2>Benefits of AGS<a class="headerlink" href="#benefits-of-ags" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>So, what are the advantages of AGS over conventional activated sludge flocs? For a large part, AGS is similar to activated sludge. One can find the same species in an aerobic granule as in an activated sludge floc <span id="id14">[<a class="reference internal" href="references.html#id11" title="M. Ali, Z. Wang, K. W. Salam, A. R. Hari, M. Pronk, M. C. M. van Loosdrecht, and P. E. Saikaly.

Also, the species distribution is different in different granules sizes. It was shown by <span id="id15">Ali <em>et al.</em> [<a class="reference internal" href="references.html#id11" title="M. Ali, Z. Wang, K. W. Salam, A. R. Hari, M. Pronk, M. C. M. van Loosdrecht, and P. E. Saikaly.

Technol., 53(14):8291–8301, 2019. doi:10.1021/acs.est.8b07303.">2019</a>]</span> that for example, <em>Ca.</em> Accumulibacter phosphatis is more enriched in the largest granule sizes. This is to be expected because the current AGS reactors are fed from the bottom of the reactor, favouring the largest granule fraction with readily biodegradable substrates (see chapter <a class="reference internal" href="chapter-5.html#ch-mechanisms"><span class="std std-ref">On the mechanisms</span></a>), used by <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-PAO"><span class="xref std std-term">PAO</span></a>. Because of the similarities between granules and flocs, many processes will be similar. There are three major differences that make the use of AGS advantageous:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The good settling properties of AGS</p></li>
<li><p>The dense biomass and related biofilm properties</p></li>
<li><p>The production of biopolymers with special properties</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The <em>settling properties</em> of AGS are very different from the settling properties of conventional activated sludge flocs (chapter <a class="reference internal" href="chapter-3.html#ch-settlingbehavior"><span class="std std-ref">Settling behaviour</span></a>). Activated sludge flocs will settle bulk-like, meaning the sludge bed will behave very much like one coherent entity, while AGS will settle as discrete particles. This results in a distinct separation between the sludge phase (the granules) and the water phase (outside the granules). Individual granules can settle with settling velocities up to 100 m h<sup>-1</sup>, but in a sludge bed the actual settling velocity is (much) lower because of interactions between the granules. Nevertheless, the settling properties of an AGS sludge bed are much better than the settling properties of a bed with activated sludge flocs. Superficial flow velocities in an AGS reactor can be 5-10 times higher than in a secondary clarifier. As a result, the process of liquid/solid separation through gravity induced settling is much faster with AGS than with activated sludge flocs. In <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-CAS"><span class="xref std std-term">CAS</span></a> installations liquid/solid separation is typically done in a separate tank (secondary clarifier), or a separate phase in the case of a conventional SBR (settling and decanting phase), consuming a lot of surface area. In AGS the liquid/solid separation is started in a short settling phase at the end of the cycle, but mainly takes place during the simultaneous feeding of influent and decanting of effluent. As a result, the liquid/solid separation will only add about 10 % to the AGS reactor volume.</p>
<p>Aerobic granules grow in <em>dense aggregates</em>, with a typical biomass concentration of 35 to 50 kg m<sup>-3</sup>. Because of voidage between granules, a settled sludge bed can have a concentration of 25 kg m<sup>-3</sup>. A typical biomass concentration in an AGS reactor is 8 kg m<sup>-3</sup>, but values over 15 kg m<sup>-3</sup> can be reached in practice. This means the biomass concentration often is not the limiting factor in the AGS process. For example, a temperature drop will not decrease the nitrification rates of an AGS reactor as much as in a CAS system <span id="id16">[<a class="reference internal" href="references.html#id20" title="M. K. de Kreuk, M. Pronk, and M. C. M. van Loosdrecht. Formation of aerobic granules and conversion processes in an aerobic granular sludge reactor at moderate and low temperatures. Water Res., 39(18):4476–4484, 2005. doi:10.1016/j.watres.2005.08.031.">de Kreuk <em>et al.</em>, 2005</a>]</span>, because of an abundance of nitrifiers in the biomass. The thickness of the biofilm also allows for anoxic conditions in the centre of the granule during aeration, making it possible to nitrify and to denitrify during aeration. Activated sludge flocs are fully penetrated with oxygen much quicker, often making it necessary to build separate denitrification tanks. With AGS denitrification can for a large part take place simultaneously <span id="id17">[<a class="reference internal" href="references.html#id20" title="M. K. de Kreuk, M. Pronk, and M. C. M. van Loosdrecht. Formation of aerobic granules and conversion processes in an aerobic granular sludge reactor at moderate and low temperatures.

It is therefore often not necessary to apply a denitrification phase, which is the CAS equivalent of not building a denitrification tank.</p>
<p><em>Recourse recovery</em> is an important aspect in wastewater treatment nowadays. It was found that the extracellular polymeric matrix of AGS (Kaumera) can be recovered to produce novel materials. Although in activated sludge flocs similar polymers can be found, the gel-forming properties of polymers found in AGS form an interesting new resource. Low end application of these polymers can be found in agriculture (plant growth stimulant), but also potential high-end application such as flame retardants and high strength composite materials are already produced in the lab <span id="id18">[<a class="reference internal" href="references.html#id17" title="M. Pronk, E. J. H. van Dijk, and M. C. M. van Loosdrecht. Aerobic granular sludge. In Guanghao Chen, George A Ekama, Mark C M van Loosdrecht, and Damir Brdjanovic, editors, Biol. Wastewater Treat.

And this future is already here. The first full-scale recovery unit was built in Zutphen and opened in 2019. Here a dedicated Nereda<sup>®</sup> plant is built, treating wastewater from a dairy industry, with the sole purpose to produce AGS for polymer extraction.</p>

<p>In this dissertation I often used data and biomass from pilot-scale and full-scale Nereda<sup>®</sup> reactors. Nereda<sup>®</sup> is the brand name of the aerobic granular sludge technology developed by Royal HaskoningDHV, which is also the company I was working for during the PhD research. After the first successful introduction in the dairy industry in 2005, several other industrial applications followed, as well as the first small municipal wastewater treatment plants. The next marker point in the history of Nereda<sup>®</sup> was the start-up of the first full-scale municipal plant in Epe, the Netherlands. The opening of the Nereda<sup>®</sup> plant in Epe generated a lot of national and international publicity, accelerating Nereda<sup>®</sup> development. Two years later, in the period 2013-2014, another 4 Nereda<sup>®</sup> plants were constructed in the Netherlands: Garmerwolde, Vroomshoop, Dinxperlo and the <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-PNU"><span class="xref std std-term">PNU</span></a>. The Garmerwolde plant was a breakthrough in size. With a design capacity of 140000 p.e. it was  larger than all previous Nereda<sup>®</sup> plants combined and the first one larger than 100000 p.e.. The PNU later became the primary research facility for municipal wastewater based aerobic granular sludge research and many of the experiments described in this dissertation were performed at this location. From this time forward more and more Nereda<sup>®</sup> plants were built, spanning over all continents (except Antarctica) - see <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-maphistory"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 2</span></a>.</p>

<p>A Nereda<sup>®</sup> reactor is a <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-SBR"><span class="xref std std-term">SBR</span></a>, in contrast to conventional continuous flow-through reactors with flocculent activated sludge. A mathematician would say that the difference between a SBR system and a flow through system is that the dimensions are interchanged. In a flow-through system the different process conditions (anaerobic, anoxic and aerobic) are separated in space and (more or less) constant over time. In an SBR system the process conditions are separated in time, but are applied in the same reactor. This is shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-contvssbr"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 3</span></a>. Here the <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-mUCT"><span class="xref std std-term">MUCT</span></a> process is compared with the Nereda<sup>®</sup> process. In the mUCT process biomass is recycled back to the anaerobic reactor, for fermentation and uptake of <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-VFA"><span class="xref std std-term">VFA</span></a> from the influent. In this anaerobic reactor, polyphosphate is degraded as an energy source for the uptake of VFAs. Then the biomass together with the influent, flows into the anoxic tanks for denitrification (and some phosphate uptake) and subsequently into the aerated reactors, for nitrification, phosphorus uptake and COD removal. Separation of the purified water and the biomass happens in the secondary clarifier. The thickened sludge is pumped back to the first anoxic tank. All of these process steps can be found in the Nereda<sup>®</sup> process. The anaerobic contact between biomass and influent happens when the reactor is fed from the bottom into the (settled) sludge bed. Because of the plug flow feeding, there is limited mixing of purified water from the previous batch and the influent, allowing for anaerobic conditions. After the feeding phase, the tank is aerated. The thickness of the granular biofilm allows for <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-SND"><span class="xref std std-term">SND</span></a> and in many cases no separate anoxic phase is necessary. If necessary, a pre-denitrification or post-denitrification phase can be applied. The separation of the purified water and the granular sludge is done in the settling phase.</p>

<p>The Nereda<sup>®</sup> cycle has three main phases, the feed and decant phase, the reaction phase and the settling and wasting phase. Feeding and settling happens simultaneous, as opposed to conventional SBR systems where feeding and decanting are separate phases. <em>Feeding and decanting</em> can be done simultaneously because of the advantageous settling behaviour of the AGS. At the superficial flow velocities applied in Nereda<sup>®</sup> (up to 5 m h<sup>-1</sup>), conventional activated sludge would washout with the effluent. The settling properties of AGS (see chapter <a class="reference internal" href="chapter-3.html#ch-settlingbehavior"><span class="std std-ref">Settling behaviour</span></a>) allow for a good separation between biomass and purified water during the feeding phase. The plug flow feeding regime causes a limited contact between fresh influent and purified water from the previous batch, and at the same time ensures good anaerobic contact between influent and the settled sludge bed. Readily biodegradable COD is taken up by the biomass, releasing phosphate in the process, because of the <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-EBPR"><span class="xref std std-term">EBPR</span></a> process. In the <em>reaction phase</em>, aerobic and anoxic conversions take place. The reactor is aerated, and COD and ammonia are oxidized. Through the process of <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-SND"><span class="xref std std-term">SND</span></a> (part) of the nitrate formed is converted into nitrogen gas. Phosphorus is also removed because of the uptake of phosphate by the <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-PAO"><span class="xref std std-term">PAO</span></a>. For extra nitrate reduction sometimes pre- or post-denitrification phases are added to the reaction phase. More advanced methods for optimizing SND are also available <span id="id20">[<a class="reference internal" href="references.html#id21" title="E. J. H. van Dijk, K. M. van Schagen, and A. T. Oosterhoff. Controlled Simultaneous Nitrification and Denitrification in Wastewater Treatment. 2020.">van Dijk <em>et al.</em>, 2020</a>]</span>. The <em>settling and wasting</em> phase often starts with a short period of aeration to strip dissolved nitrogen gas from the water phase (chapter <a class="reference internal" href="chapter-2.html#ch-effluentsuspendedsolids"><span class="std std-ref">Suspended solids</span></a>). This aeration also mixes the biomass in the reactor. After a short settling period (depending on the applied selection pressure), the top of the sludge bed is wasted. Only the top of the sludge bed is wasted, allowing for selectively discharging flocs and other bad settling sludge from the sludge bed (see also chapter <a class="reference internal" href="chapter-5.html#ch-mechanisms"><span class="std std-ref">On the mechanisms</span></a>). After this the cycle starts over with simultaneous feeding and decanting.</p>
<p>Most Nereda<sup>®</sup> plants have 2 or more reactors. This is because most plants must take in wastewater continuously. In the reaction phase, and the settling and wasting phase, a reactor cannot receive influent. To overcome this problem, multiple reactors can be scheduled is such a way, that 1 reactor is always available to receive influent. This method of scheduling relates the feeding time to the number of reactors and the time available for reaction and settling. With only 2 reactors the feeding time will become equal to the time for reaction and settling, making the reactors relatively inefficient. With 3 or more reactors this is less of a problem. A solution for this inefficiency is application of an influent buffer. This allows for an interruption of the continuous feeding and an efficient reactor scheduling, also with 1 or 2 reactors available <span id="id21">[<a class="reference internal" href="references.html#id17" title="M. Pronk, E. J. H. van Dijk, and M. C. M. van Loosdrecht. Aerobic granular sludge. In Guanghao Chen, George A Ekama, Mark C M van Loosdrecht, and Damir Brdjanovic, editors, Biol. Wastewater Treat.

<h2>About this dissertation<a class="headerlink" href="#about-this-dissertation" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>Aerobic granular sludge technology is becoming a widely accepted technology for wastewater treatment. Although it is widely accepted and soon the 100th full-scale treatment plant will be built, there are still many discoveries to be made. Mechanisms and fundamentals that are common ground for flocculent activated sludge are still undiscovered lands for aerobic granular sludge. In this dissertation I aimed to fill in a few of the important knowledge gaps we face in design and operation of AGS technology.</p>
<p>In chapter <a class="reference internal" href="chapter-2.html#ch-effluentsuspendedsolids"><span class="std std-ref">Effluent suspended solids</span></a> the topic of effluent suspended solids was explored. In the first 15 years of AGS development the amount of suspended solids in the effluent of AGS reactors received little attention. This is mainly because the process conditions and the hydraulics of lab scale reactors are very different from full-scale reactors and lab reactors are mainly designed for optimal biological conditions. In the first full-scale installations effluent suspended solids were not a topic, because it concerned industrial installations discharging effluent to the sewer. The first full-scale domestic AGS plant in the Netherlands was Epe, which due to discharge to a small river needed post-treatment (sand filtration) of the full flow, to remove all solids from the Nereda<sup>®</sup> effluent. Only when more full-scale installations were built did it become clear that the concentration of effluent suspended solids could become too high. It was shown that degasification of nitrogen gas and wash-out of bad settling particles were the major source for these elevated concentrations and it could be solved relatively easily. In this chapter the mechanisms behind the degasification of nitrogen gas were explored. It was shown that effluent suspended solid concentrations comparable with CAS could be achieved with an AGS reactor.</p>
<p>In chapter <a class="reference internal" href="chapter-3.html#ch-settlingbehavior"><span class="std std-ref">Settling behaviour</span></a> the settling behaviour of AGS was explored. As described above, the advantageous settling characteristics of AGS are a fundamental part of the technology. In previous research it was shown that individual granules can settle very fast, but in practice it is not about individual granules, but about the behaviour of the sludge bed, with interactions between trillions of individual granules. The settling behaviour of activated sludge is well described with widely accepted mathematical models. These models generally describe the behaviour of the sludge bed based on 1 sludge phase and a bed going through regimes of particulate settling, zone settling and compression. In AGS the particle coherence is much more discrete, demanding a different mathematical approach to describe the settling behaviour. In this chapter this different approach was combined with validation based on full-scale measurements.</p>
<p>Nitrous oxide is a gas commonly emitted from wastewater treatment plants, as a side product from nitrogen removal. Since nitrous oxide is a strong greenhouse gas, emission from wastewater treatment plants contributes to global warming. A long-term measurement campaign was performed in a  Nereda<sup>®</sup> reactor at the wastewater treatment plant in Dinxperlo. In chapter <a class="reference internal" href="chapter-4.html#ch-nitrousoxides"><span class="std std-ref">Nitrous oxide emission</span></a>, the dynamics of nitrous oxide emissions are explored.</p>
<p>How do aerobic granules grow? That is the question asked in chapter <a class="reference internal" href="chapter-5.html#ch-mechanisms"><span class="std std-ref">On the mechanisms</span></a>. After more than 20 years of research we know how to grow granules, but we lack an in depth understanding of how they grow. In this chapter we proposed 6 fundamental mechanisms leading to growth of aerobic granular sludge. A mathematical model was made to show the importance of the different mechanisms.</p>
<p>Where do we go from here? The journey of AGS is only starting. We will explore the future in the <a class="reference internal" href="outlook.html#ch-outlook"><span class="std std-ref">Outlook</span></a>.</p>
