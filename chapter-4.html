<h2>Abstract<a class="headerlink" href="#abstract" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>The nitrous oxides emission was measured over 7 months in the full-scale aerobic granular sludge plant in Dinxperlo. Nitrous oxide concentrations were measured in the bulk liquid and the off-gas of the Nereda<sup>®</sup> reactor. Combined with the batch wise operation of the reactor, this gave a high information density and a better insight into nitrous oxide emission in general. The average emission factor was 0.33 % based on the total nitrogen concentration in the influent. The yearly average emission factor was estimated to be between 0.25 % and 0.30 % of the nitrogen load. The average emission factor is comparable to continuous activated sludge plants, and it is low compared to other sequencing batch systems. The variability in the emission factor increased when the reactor temperature was below 14 °C, showing higher emission factors during the winter period. A change in the process control in the winter period reduced the variability, reducing the emission factors to a level comparable to the summer period. Different process control might be necessary at high and low temperatures to obtain a consistently low nitrous oxide emission. Rainy weather conditions lowered the emission factor, both in the rainy weather batches and the subsequent dry weather flow batches. This was attributed to the first flush from the sewer at the start of rainy weather conditions, resulting in a temporarily increased sludge loading.</p>

Due to the strong deviation from conditions in full-scale reactors in these experiments, it is uncertain how relevant the reported values are regarding full-scale installations. Laboratory systems are very good at isolating a specific parameter, but translation towards full-scale wastewater treatment plants is challenging because of differences in influent composition, process control and reactor design and operation.</p>
<p>Because of the potentially significant contribution to the carbon footprint of full-scale AGS processes, it is important to quantify the nitrous oxide emission factors. Hereto the nitrous oxide emission from a full scale Nereda<sup>®</sup> plant treating domestic wastewater was monitored for 7 consecutive months. Two different methods were used to measure the nitrous oxide emissions, namely by measuring the nitrous oxide concentrations continuously in the water phase and by measuring it in the off-gas during aeration. The former has the advantage of showing nitrous oxide kinetics under anoxic conditions, when the aeration is turned off. The latter has the benefit of measuring the direct nitrous oxide emission without the need for a conversion algorithm. Combined with the dynamic behaviour of the repeated batch-wise operated system, a high information density could be obtained on the nitrous oxide behaviour from the plant. The goal was to get better insight in the nitrous oxide emissions of the full-scale AGS process, as well as to understand the major factors preventing and leading to elevated nitrous oxide emissions in full scale AGS systems.</p>

<p>The nitrous oxide emission from the reactor was measured by determining the nitrous oxide concentration in the off-gas of the reactor during aeration (<a class="reference internal" href="#fig-scheme-hood"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 27</span></a>). A polyethylene floating hood with a cross-sectional area of 0.55 m<sup>2</sup> was used to capture the air escaping the surface area of the reactor during aeration. The inside of the hood was partially filled with polyurethane foam to reduce the headspace and limit the gas retention time to the analysers. Part of the off-gas that passed through the hood was transported via a transparent hose and cooled to 4 °C to remove the moisture. The gas concentrations were measured in two online gas analysers (Rosemount NGA 2000 MLT for oxygen and carbon dioxide; Servomex 4900 for methane and nitrous oxide). Calibration of the analysers was performed using gas cylinders containing known concentrations of the studied gases. For accurate calculations, the temperature, pressure and relative humidity of the outside air were also measured, using a micro sensor (Bosch BME280). The nitrous oxide concentrations were converted into mass fluxes using the method described by Baeten <span id="id15">[<a class="reference internal" href="references.html#id84" title="J. E.

<p>During dry weather conditions the reactors have a fixed cycle time of 6 hours. When the flow increases due to rainy weather, the cycle will adapt to treat the increased amount of water. The feeding time will increase from 60 min minutes to 75 min and the feed flow from the buffer increases from about 180 m<sup>3</sup> h<sup>-1</sup> to a maximum of 600 m<sup>3</sup> h<sup>-1</sup>.

The figure shows online measurements of the concentration of ammonium, nitrate, phosphate and dissolved oxygen during three cycles. Since these sensors were positioned at the top of the reactor, and the reactor was plug flow fed from the bottom, the measurements during feeding represent the effluent concentrations. The cycle started with a feed phase, where influent was added to the bottom of reactor and effluent was decanted from the top simultaneously. After feeding, the reaction phase started, where the reactor was aerated. The reactor was mixed by the aeration. At the start of the aeration phase the concentrations of ammonium and phosphate appear to increase, which was caused by the mixing of the bottom layer with influent water and top layer with the effluent water. After the reaction phase the biomass was allowed to settle and the cycle restarted for the next batch.</p>

The analysis was done based on the starting time of the batch, which was several hours before the actual emission of nitrous oxide was measured. Due to the 6 hours cycle time during DWF out of 1043 batches analysed in this study, only 19 started between 3 AM and 4 AM, while 71 batches started 6 PM and 7 PM.</p>

<h3>Dynamic nitrous oxide behaviour<a class="headerlink" href="#dynamic-nitrous-oxide-behaviour" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>The complexity and dynamics of nitrous oxide emissions is illustrated in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-n2o-batch"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 36</span></a>.  Net production of nitrous oxide as well as net consumption of nitrous oxide was visible in the online measurements. The first batch started [marker 1] without any nitrous oxide in the bulk liquid and therefore also no emission through the off-gas at the start of the aeration phase. At the start of the aeration, the dissolved oxygen concentration increased, and a first peak of nitrous oxide emission could be observed [marker 2]. Also, a simultaneous decrease of the nitrate concentration was observed, caused by mixing of the nitrate remaining from the previous batch with newly fed influent, low in nitrate. When the dissolved oxygen concentration increased further, the nitrous oxide concentration in the bulk liquid and off-gas decreased again (marker [2] to [3]). In this period, the nitrous oxide production rate was lower than the combined effect of stripping through the off-gas and denitrification of nitrous oxide. Further on in the aeration phase, the nitrous oxide concentration in both the bulk liquid and the off-gas increased [marker 3]. Towards the end of the aeration phase the dissolved oxygen concentration was lowered [marker 4] and a sudden increase of the nitrous oxide concentration in the bulk liquid was seen. Hereafter the aeration, and thus mixing, was stopped allowing the biomass to settle [marker 5]. The reactor was ready to receive the next influent batch [marker 5]. During the feeding (marker [5] to [6]) the nitrous oxide concentration in the bulk liquid stayed constant because the sensor was situated at the top of the reactor and the sludge bed had settled to the bottom of the reactor. There was no sludge present in the top layer and no biological processes occurred in the top part of the reactor. After this feeding phase, the aeration phase started again, and the nitrous oxide concentration dropped due to mixing before the production started again [marker 7]. Halfway through the reaction phase, the oxygen concentration in the bulk liquid was lowered [marker 8]. This led to a period where the production of nitrate was limited, but ammonium was still being converted, thus optimizing for simultaneous nitrification and denitrification. After lowering of the oxygen concentration, a similar, although lower, initial increase of the nitrous oxide could be seen [marker 9] as was visible in the previous batch [marker 2]. At the end of this second batch the nitrous oxide was almost completely removed [marker 10].</p>
<p>The process control used here automatically balances nitrification and denitrification to optimize simultaneous nitrification and denitrification to get a maximum total nitrogen removal. This was done by dynamically altering the dissolved oxygen set-point and sometimes this resulted in a drop of the oxygen concentration in the reaction phase as previously described. In <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-n2o-process-control"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 38</span></a> an example of this behaviour is shown. This seems to trigger a nitrous oxide production response. When the oxygen concentration dropped [marker 1] the nitrous oxide production in the bulk liquid and the off-gas increased [marker 2].</p>
<p>On the 24th of February the process control was changed to a fixed oxygen set-point (2.5 mg L<sup>-1</sup>) during the reaction phase, with the reaction phase being split-up in an aeration phase and an unaerated post-denitrification phase. This had an immediate effect on the nitrous oxide production. An example of a batch under this new process control is shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-n2o-process-control"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 38</span></a>. During the reaction phase, almost no nitrous oxide was produced. Only when the aeration was stopped in the post-denitrification phase, some nitrous oxide was produced, but this did not lead to any emission, because the aeration was switched off and the nitrous oxide was denitrified before the end of the cycle. This change led to a decrease of the emission factor to 0.15 % during the three weeks this process control was used.</p>
<p>The nitrogen removal also changed slightly by the change in the process control. The average ammonium effluent concentration was 10 % higher (3.2 mg L<sup>-1</sup> after the change, compared to 2.9 mg L<sup>-1</sup> before the change). The average nitrate effluent concentration was similar under both process controls (5.3 mg L<sup>-1</sup>). The SND efficiency over the whole period was 69(15) %. It was 58(12) % after the change compared to 70(15) %.</p>

When the flow towards the plant increased because of rainy weather, a first flush arrived at the plant, increasing the ammonium load in the reactor. The load in this batch was too high for the aeration capacity and the reduced aeration duration, leaving some elevated levels of ammonium in the effluent. The process control focussed mainly on nitrification, aerating the system at maximum capacity. Little nitrous oxide is formed in this batch. In the two batches hereafter, the load returned to normal levels, but still the focus was mainly on nitrification. In these batches, little nitrous oxide was formed. When the RWF event was finished and the flow to the plant returned to normal, the cycle times lengthened again, but still the emission of nitrous oxides remained close to zero.</p>

<p>This study is the first long-term campaign measuring nitrous oxide emissions of a full-scale AGS reactor treating sewage. A Nereda<sup>®</sup> reactor at the wastewater treatment plant of Dinxperlo was monitored for 7 consecutive months. In this period an average emission factor of 0.33 % was measured.  This means that 0.33 % of the incoming nitrogen load was emitted as nitrous oxide with the off-gas. The daily averaged emission factor ranged from 0.02 % to 1.58 %.

The average value found in the short-term research 0.7 % are higher than the average value found in the current research, but the value of  0.7 % is well within the variability of this long-term study, stressing the importance of long-term research. Since the emission was measured for only 7 months, the higher winter values contribute proportionately strong in the average value presented. A 12 month yearly averaged emission factor is estimated to be in the range of  0.25 % to 0.3 %.</p>
<p>Compared to conventional activated sludge (CAS) systems, the values obtained fall well within the reported ranges in literature.

The variability of the nitrous oxide emission increases when the water temperature drops below 14 °C in December. At temperatures above 14 °C the emission factor per batch varies between 0 % and 0.5 %, while below 14 °C the emission factor ranges between 0 % and 2.5 %. Contradictorily, March shows the lowest monthly emission factor (0.15 %), at the lowest average temperature of 9.7 °C. This difference may be caused by a change in process control in March. <span id="id25">Daelman <em>et al.</em> [<a class="reference internal" href="references.html#id99" title="Matthijs R. J.

In the current study effluent nitrite concentrations were consistently low, with an average value of 0.05 mg L<sup>-1</sup> (<a class="reference internal" href="#tab-influent-effluent-dinxperlo"><span class="std std-numref">Table 8</span></a>). Although nitrite concentrations were not measured during the cycle, elevated levels of nitrite during the cycle would also, at least partially, have ended up in the effluent. Since this was not the case here, no major effect of nitrite on the nitrous oxide emissions is expected.</p>
<p>The drop in the temperature in December was related to the inflow of melting snow, and in 4 days the water temperature in the reactor dropped from 13 °C to 8 °C. At these low temperatures of 8 °C the nitrification rates dropped considerably, but the ammonium effluent concentration was still below the consent value. At the same time, the nitrous oxide concentrations in both off-gas and bulk liquid were almost zero or below the detection limit for several days, until the temperature increased again above 9 °C.  In the week before this event the variability of the emission factor was already increasing, but after this event the variability of the emission factor of nitrous oxide further increased after the water temperature was recovered to temperatures above 10 °C.</p>
<p>A diurnal pattern is observed in the data (<a class="reference internal" href="#fig-n2o-diurnal"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 35</span></a>). The batches starting between 4h and 14h show a lower average emission factor than the batches starting between 15h and 3h. The relation is not as clear as for CAS systems <span id="id27">[<a class="reference internal" href="references.html#id99" title="Matthijs R. J. Daelman, Ellen M. van Voorthuizen, Udo G. J.

The lowest average emission is found between 3h and 15h. It is uncertain what causes this, but variations in batch loading may play a role. Since the reactors are operated with a fixed cycle time of 6 hours during DWF conditions, the volumetric exchange ratio is lower if the total flow to the wastewater treatment plant is lower.</p>

In aerobic granular sludge nitrification and denitrification happen simultaneously during the aeration phase, which make it difficult to distinguish nitrous oxide production from nitrification and denitrification during the aeration phase <span id="id31">[<a class="reference internal" href="references.html#id82" title="M. K. de Kreuk, J. J. Heijnen, and M. C. M. van Loosdrecht. Simultaneous COD, nitrogen, and phosphate removal by aerobic granular sludge. Biotechnol.

Nevertheless, there seems to be clear evidence that both processes contribute to the production of nitrous oxides. In most batches there is no dissolved nitrous oxide present at the start of the cycle. In these cycles nitrous oxide production coincides with the conversion of ammonium and the production of nitrate (<a class="reference internal" href="#fig-n2o-batch"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 36</span></a> at [marker 3]). Often, a peak of nitrous oxide at the start of the aeration phase is observed (<a class="reference internal" href="#fig-n2o-batch"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 36</span></a> at [marker 2]). This peak seems to be caused by denitrification of nitrate left over from the previous cycle, because nitrification has not started yet. It is not clear if nitrous oxide is produced by partial denitrification caused by lack of COD at the end of the previous cycle or by rapid denitrification on readily biodegradable COD from the fresh influent. In both cases the increase of the nitrous oxide concentration is primarily caused by mixing of the reactor (aeration) and the decrease seems to be primarily caused by denitrification of nitrous oxides on readily biodegradable COD, although in the latter case stripping of nitrous oxide also plays a role.</p>
<p>It is likely that denitrification acts more as a sink for nitrous oxide at the start of the cycle after feeding and that denitrification acts more as a source for nitrous oxide at the end of the cycle, when most COD from the feeding phase (both storage polymers in the sludge and COD in the bulk liquid) is consumed. That would implicate the nitrous oxide production observed when nitrification starts as a net production rate resulting from production by ammonia oxidizing bacteria and denitrification by heterotrophic organisms. Understanding the mechanisms and when nitrous oxide production exceeds consumption could be important for the development of nitrous oxide emission control strategies.</p>
<p>The dissolved oxygen concentration is considered an important parameter to control nitrous oxide emissions, and concentrations below 1 mg L<sup>-1</sup> during nitrification would stimulate nitrifier denitrification due to oxygen limitation <span id="id32">[<a class="reference internal" href="references.html#id94" title="M. J. Kampschreur, H. Temmink, R. Kleerebezem, M. S. M. Jetten, and M. C. M. van Loosdrecht. Nitrous oxide emission during wastewater treatment.

Oxygen limitation in biofilms is a well-known factor even under higher oxygen concentrations <span id="id33">[<a class="reference internal" href="references.html#id86" title="H. Odegaard, B. Rusten, and T. Westrum. A new moving bed biofilm reactor - applications and results. Water Sci.

It is therefore not surprising that lower oxygen concentrations seem to result in higher nitrous oxide emissions. In <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-n2o-batch"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 36</span></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-n2o-oxygendrop"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 37</span></a> an increase of the nitrous oxide emission can be seen if the dissolved oxygen concentration drops below 1 mg L<sup>-1</sup>. A decreasing dissolved oxygen concentration will also shift the process to denitrification because the size of the anoxic zone within the aerobic granules will increase <span id="id34">[<a class="reference internal" href="references.html#id82" title="M. K. de Kreuk, J. J. Heijnen, and M. C. M. van Loosdrecht. Simultaneous COD, nitrogen, and phosphate removal by aerobic granular sludge. Biotechnol. Bioeng., 90(6):761–769, 2005. doi:10.1002/bit.20470.">de Kreuk <em>et al.</em>, 2005</a>]</span> . Since this decreasing dissolved oxygen concentration mostly happens towards the end of the reaction phase, denitrification might act more as a source than a sink of nitrous oxide as carbon availability is low. This would result in a double effect on the nitrous oxide emission: both the nitrifier pathway and the denitrifier pathway could increase nitrous oxide production in this situation.</p>
<p>A clear effect of rain events is shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-n2o-rain"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 39</span></a>. Rain events cause the batch size to increase, because more water arrives at the plant. In total 173 batches (18 %) were classified as RWF batches. These batches had an average emission factor of 0.09 %, which is less than one-third of the 0.33 % found for all batches. The reason for these lower emissions during RWF conditions is uncertain, but there are several processes influencing the emission factor during RWF. Under RWF conditions the flow to the plant increases from 0 - 175 m<sup>3</sup> h<sup>-1</sup> during DWF conditions to up to 600 m<sup>3</sup> h<sup>-1</sup> under RWF conditions. Since the reactor is operated as a sequencing batch reactor, the scheduling needs to be adapted to handle the increased inflow of wastewater <span id="id35">[<a class="reference internal" href="references.html#id90" title="G. H. Chen, M. C. M. van Loosdrecht, G. A. Ekama, and D. Brdjanovic. Biological Wastewater Treatment: Principles, Modeling and Design. IWA Publishing, 2020. ISBN 9781789060355 1789060354. doi:10.2166/9781789060362.">Chen <em>et al.</em>, 2020</a>]</span> . This is done by decreasing the total cycle time and running more batches per day. This leads to shorter, more intense aeration phases, with higher oxygen concentrations. On average, the aeration phase during RWF is 35 minutes shorter than during DWF. Secondly RWF batches can be split in two groups. At the start of a rain event a first flush arrives at the plant, due to the presence of pressure pipelines in the sewer. The load exceeds the aeration capacity, leading to incomplete nitrification and thus less potential for nitrous oxide production. After this initial peak load, the load returns to a more average value, but the aeration remains relatively short and intense, focussing on nitrification. The lack of cycle time during RWF results in an increased nitrate effluent concentration (1.7 mg L<sup>-1</sup> under DWF conditions and 4.4 mg L<sup>-1</sup> under RWF conditions). The total SND efficiency on average was 69 ±15 %, but was slightly lower during RWF (65 ±13 %) compared to DWF (70 ±15 %), but during DWF batches, SND happens at lower dissolved oxygen concentrations. It also appears that the RWF event influences the DWF batches following the RWF event (<a class="reference internal" href="#fig-n2o-rain"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 39</span></a>, [5] and [6]). In these DWF batches nitrous oxide emissions are close to zero. This might be the result of the first flush at the start of the rain event, which results in a high sludge loading. A high sludge load will result in higher storage polymer concentration in the granular biomass in this specific batch, which might stretch out to the following batches. This leads to more denitrification capability of the plant. It appears that the denitrification process in these batches acts mainly as a sink for nitrous oxide, denitrifying nitrous oxide at a higher rate than it is produced. Eventually, the positive effect of the higher sludge loading will dissipate, and normal nitrous oxide emissions will return.</p>
<p>The nitrous oxide concentrations in the bulk liquid are seldom higher than 0.3 mg L<sup>-1</sup> and in most cases the concentration at the end of the cycle is close to zero. This means that in most cycles the denitrification capacity of nitrous oxide is also present towards the end of the cycle. This study observed nitrous oxide conversion rates up to 1 mg L<sup>-1</sup> h<sup>-1</sup>. This rate is a net rate, because it happens simultaneously with denitrification of nitrate, which also can produce nitrous oxide as an intermediate product. In most cases in less than 30 minutes of anoxic conditions all nitrous oxide in the bulk liquid is denitrified. This suggests a high nitrous oxide conversion potential is present, if the right conditions are met.</p>
</section>
<section id="effect-of-process-control">
<h3>Effect of process control<a class="headerlink" href="#effect-of-process-control" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>The nitrous oxide emission factors varied between 0.02 % and 1.58 % per day, most of the batches being below 0.5 %. The emission of nitrous oxide might be lowered by changing the process control. The decrease of the emission factor from 0.57 % in February to 0.15 % in March by changing the process control to a fixed aeration strategy is an example of this. A more stable dissolve oxygen concentration during the aeration phase led to a remarkable decrease in the emission of nitrous oxide. On the other hand, the process control focusing on simultaneous nitrification and denitrification did not lead to elevated nitrous oxide emission in the summer period.</p>
<p>Different process control strategies may be necessary during summer and winter conditions to limit nitrous oxide emission under all conditions.</p>
<p>It also seems that the production of nitrous oxide during the cycle is increasing, when the DO drops below 1 mg L<sup>-1</sup>. This could be easily prevented by adjusting the process control as to not allow for the oxygen to dip below the required set point. Another potential improvement relates to the initial peak at the start of the aeration (<a class="reference internal" href="#fig-n2o-batch"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 36</span></a>). This initial peak could be prevented by adding a pre-denitrification phase to the cycle, aiming to remove this residual nitrate, simultaneously removing the nitrous oxide formed during settling and feeding. Another option is to focus on post-denitrification to prevent high amounts of residual nitrate to be present in the next cycle, thereby limiting the nitrous oxide emission peak.</p>
<p>Compared with a continuously fed activated sludge system, an SBR system gives a much higher information density on the changes in nitrous oxide production and consumption. This gives the possibility to develop effective process control strategies to minimize the nitrous oxide emissions. A maximum nitrous oxide concentration of 0.3 mg L<sup>-1</sup> and a net denitrification rate up to 1 mg L<sup>-1</sup> h<sup>-1</sup> was measured. This would mean that a denitrification phase of 20 minutes should be enough to remove nitrous oxide from the water phase in most cases. Splitting the main aeration phase and adding one or more intermediate denitrification steps could be an effective measure to minimize nitrous oxide emission.</p>

<h3>Difference with conventional SBR systems<a class="headerlink" href="#difference-with-conventional-sbr-systems" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>The AGS reactor was operated as a sequencing batch reactor. A comparison with flocculent SBR systems is therefore of interest. As shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-vasilaki"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 40</span></a>, regular SBR systems have shown to have higher emission factors than continuously fed activated sludge systems. High nitrous oxide emissions in SBRs are attributed to sudden changes in the concentrations of ammonium, nitrate and nitrite within the cycle or to accumulated dissolved nitrous oxide during anoxic settling and decanting in the subsequent aerobic phase <span id="id36">[<a class="reference internal" href="references.html#id95" title="V.

These conventional SBR systems show emission factors up to 5.6 %  which is much higher than the value of 0.33 %  found in this study. This might be caused by differences in process conditions. The feeding in the AGS process is strictly anaerobic, which is achieved by plug flow feeding from the bottom of the reactor. By this plug flow, the nitrate remaining in the reactor from the previous cycle is pushed upwards while the reactor is filled with fresh influent from the bottom. This limits the contact between sludge, COD and nitrate, preventing production of high levels of nitrous oxide during the feeding phase. While anaerobic plug flow feeding is a requirement in AGS systems, it is uncommon in SBR systems. For example, in a study by <span id="id37">[<a class="reference internal" href="references.html#id91" title="A. Rodriguez-Caballero, I. Aymerich, R. Marques, M. Poch, and M. Pijuan.

<h3>Comparison water phase and gas phase measurement<a class="headerlink" href="#comparison-water-phase-and-gas-phase-measurement" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>The nitrous oxide concentration was measured by two different methods: firstly, by measuring the nitrous oxide concentration in the bulk liquid by means of an online sensor and secondly by measuring the nitrous oxide concentrations in the off-gas via a gas analyser. The latter has the benefit of measuring the emission during aeration directly without the need for converting water phase concentration into emissions to the air. The downside of the off-gas method is the lack of information about what happens during the anaerobic and the anoxic phase, when the aeration is turned off. The water phase sensor gives direct insight into the production of nitrous oxide in the anoxic phase and the denitrification of nitrous oxide in the anoxic phase. The water phase sensor thus provides information that otherwise would be lost or obscured by other nitrous oxide forming processes during aeration. For the use in process control both methods can be used, but the water phase sensor is likely more effective, as it also gives information about the non-aerated phases.</p>
